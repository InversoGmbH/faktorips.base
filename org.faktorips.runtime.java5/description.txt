This project contains the Faktor-IPS runtime for Java 1.5.

Classes of this project are used e.g. by generated code.

A small special subset of these
classes is also deployed as a runtime-client JAR  with necessary classes for client applications.
The classes are described in the build script build/build.xml

To stay compatible with older platforms and the host we have to compile the runtime with java 5.
With java 6 we do not need imported packages like javax.xml.bind or javax.xml.stream because they
are part of jdk 1.6. 
The needed API is provided by two libraries added via jars.extra.classpath in build.properties. The libs
are not part of the deployed package. Hence if you want to use the runtime libraries with Java5 you have
to import the necessary JARs for your own.
