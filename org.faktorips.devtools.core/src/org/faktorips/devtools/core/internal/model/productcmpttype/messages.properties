ProductCmptType_notMarkedAsConfigurable={0} is not marked as configurable.
ProductCmptType_DuplicateFormulaName=Duplicate formula name {0}.
ProductCmptType_policyCmptTypeDoesNotSpecifyThisType={0} does not specify this type or one its supertypes as configuration type.
ProductCmptType_TypeMustConfigureAPolicyCmptTypeIfSupertypeDoes=The type must configure a poliy component type, if the supertype does\!

TableStructureUsage_msgTableStructureNotExists=The Table structure {0}  does not exists.
TableStructureUsage_msgRoleNameAlreadyInSupertype=A table structure usage with the role name "{0}" is already defined in the supertype and may not be overridden.

ProductCmptTypeMethod_FormulaNameIsMissing=The formula name is empty\!
ProductCmptTypeMethod_FormulaSignatureDatatypeMustBeAValueDatatype=Formula signature return type must be a value datatype\!
ProductCmptType_msgProductCmptTypeAbstractWhenPolicyCmptTypeAbstract=This product component class must be abstract since it configures a policy component class that is abstract.
ProductCmptTypeMethod_FormulaSignatureMustntBeAbstract=Formula signatures mustn't be marked as abstract\! The decision if formulas are executed via overriding this method with compiled Java code or by interpreting the formula, is defined by the code generator.
