ProductCmptType_InconsistentTypeHierarchies=There is a mismatch in the hierarchy between the product and the policy component side of the model.
ProductCmptType_PolicyCmptTypeDoesNotExist=The type {0} does not exist. 
ProductCmptType_notMarkedAsConfigurable={0} is not marked as configurable.  
ProductCmptType_multiplePropertyNames=Multiple property name {0}. Note: Property names are compared case insensitive. Associations, attributes. formulas and table usages are considered as properties of a product component type.
ProductCmptType_policyCmptTypeDoesNotSpecifyThisType={0} does not specify this type or one its supertypes as configuration type.
ProductCmptType_TypeMustConfigureAPolicyCmptTypeIfSupertypeDoes=The type must configure a poliy component type, if the supertype does\!
ProductCmptType_DuplicateFormulaName=Duplicate formula name {0}.
ProductCmptType_iconFileCannotBeResolved=Icon file cannot be resolved. Check path: "
ProductCmptType_msgProductCmptTypeAbstractWhenPolicyCmptTypeAbstract=This product component type must be abstract since it configures a policy component type that is abstract.
ProductCmptType_msgDuplicateFormulasNotAllowedInSameType=Formulas with the same name are not allowed within a product component type.
ProductCmptType_msgOverloadedFormulaMethodCannotBeOverridden=This method is overloaded by the formula signature {0}. Methods that are overloaded by formula signatures cannot be overridden.
ProductCmptType_MustInheritFromASupertype=This product component type must inherit from a super type, as the corresponding policy component type inherits from a super type.
ProductCmptType_caption=Product Component Type

ProductCmptTypeAssociation_error_MatchingAssociationDoesNotReferenceThis=The matching association {0} in policy component type {1} could not be constrained by this association.
ProductCmptTypeAssociation_error_MatchingAssociationDuplicateName=The association {0} matches an association with the same name.
ProductCmptTypeAssociation_error_MatchingAssociationInvalid=The matching association {0} in policy component type {1} does not match this association
ProductCmptTypeAssociation_error_matchingAssociationNotFound=Cannot find the matching association {0} in policy component type {1}

TableStructureUsage_msgTableStructureNotExists=The Table structure {0}  does not exists.
TableStructureUsage_msgRoleNameAlreadyInSupertype=A table structure usage with the role name "{0}" is already defined in the supertype and may not be overridden.
TableStructureUsage_msgInvalidRoleName=Invalid role name "{0}"
TableStructureUsage_msgSameRoleName=Duplicate role name "{0}".
TableStructureUsage_msgAtLeastOneStructureMustBeReferenced=At least one table structure must be referenced.

ProductCmptTypeMethod_FormulaNameIsMissing=The formula name is empty\!
ProductCmptTypeMethod_FormulaSignatureDatatypeMustBeAValueDatatype=Formula signature return type must be a value datatype\!
ProductCmptTypeMethod_msgNoOverloadableFormulaInSupertypeHierarchy=There exists no formula in the supertype hierarchy with the specified name that can be overloaded.
ProductCmptTypeMethod_FormulaSignatureMustntBeAbstract=Formula signatures mustn't be marked as abstract\! The decision if formulas are executed via overriding this method with compiled Java code or by interpreting the formula, is defined by the code generator.

ProductCmptPropertyExternalReference_msgReferencedPropertyCouldNotBeFound=The referenced {0} '{1}' could not be found.
