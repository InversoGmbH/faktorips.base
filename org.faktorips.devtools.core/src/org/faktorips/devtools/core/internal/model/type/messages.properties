Association_msg_DerivedUnionDoesNotExist=The derived union {0} does not exist in type's hierarchy.
Association_msg_NotMarkedAsDerivedUnion=The indicated association is not marked as derived union.
Association_msg_TargetOfDerivedUnionDoesNotExist=The target role of the derived union is empty or the target does not exists\!
Association_msg_TargetNotSubclass=The target class of this association is not a subclass (or the same class) of the derived union's target.

Attribute_msg_InvalidAttributeName=Invalid attribute name.
Attribute_msg_DefaultNotParsable_UnknownDatatype=The default value {0} can't be parsed because the datatype is unkown\!
Attribute_msg_DefaultValueIsEmptyString="empty String"
Attribute_msg_ValueTypeMismatch=The default value {0} is not a {1}.

Method_msg_NameEmpty=The name is empty\!
Method_msg_InvalidMethodname=Invalid method name.
Method_msg_abstractMethodError=The abstract method {0} can only be defined in an abstract type\!

Type_msg_AbstractMissmatch=Only an abstract type can have abstract methods.
Type_msg_supertypeNotFound=The supertype {0}  can't be found\!
Type_msg_cycleInTypeHierarchy=The type's hierarchy contains a cycle\!
Type_msg_MustOverrideAbstractMethod=Must override the abstract method {0} defined in {1}
Type_msg_MustImplementDerivedUnion=The type must either implement the derived union {0} defined in {1} or declared as abstract.\n\r(This rule can be disabled in the .ipsproject properties file via the \'derivedUnionIsImplementedRuleEnabled\' property.)

DuplicatePropertyNameValidator_msg=Duplicate property {0}. Note: Property names are compared case insensitive. Associations and attributes are both properties of a type.
Type_msgOtherTypeWithSameQNameInSameProject=There exists a {0} with the same qualified name within this project.
Type_msgOtherTypeWithSameQNameInDependentProject=There exists a {0} with the same qualified name in the IpsProject: {1}. In the IpsObjectPath of this IpsProject the IpsObjectPathEntry for the IpsProject {1} is ahead of the source folder entry. It is recommended to adjust the IpsObjectPath.
