 	<h1>Modeloverview</h1>
 	<p>
		The <em>Modeloverview</em> provides two different views for model exploring purposes.
		View number one shows the selected FaktorIPS-project and all referenced projects,
		too. It displays the overall inheritance hierarchy and all Master-to-Detail-compositions
		and aggregations. The purpose of the second view is to provide a better overview over
		the dependencies in large projects. This view displays only elements of the 
		selected project. Dependencies which are defined in the referenced projects are
		<em>inherited</em> and will be displayed as inherited associations in the current project.
		This article will refer to the first view as <em>Complete View</em> and to the second view 
		as <em>Inheritance View</em>.
	</p>
 	
 	<h2>Modeloverview in complete project context (Complete View)</h2>
 	<p>
 		These two screenshots show the structure of the the Faktor-IPS tutorial project <em>Hausratmodell</em>. It 
 		references the base project <em>Grundmodell</em>. To reduce the amount of displayed elements the <em>Product
 		Component Types</em> and <em>Policy Component Types</em> will be shown separately. The view can be switched
 		via the red marked button. After switching the view the icon of the button will change to the the other 
 		component-type icon.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Faktor-IPS model projects consist of Policy- and Product-component-types which are represented by the
		usual icons <img src="../../../images/views_editors/modeloverview/icons/PolicyCmptType.gif"/> and
		<img src="../../../images/views_editors/modeloverview/icons/ProductCmptType.gif"/>. The project structure
		will be shown as is, that means it displays the inheritance structure and associations (aggregations or master-to
		detail compositions) which are relevant for the selected project. Underlying projects and superfluous elements
		from the base projects will not be shown. Components which are a subtype of the parent
		component have the 	<img src="../../../images/views_editors/modeloverview/icons/over_co.gif"/>-icon and the 
		<img src="../../../images/views_editors/modeloverview/icons/AssociationType-Aggregation.gif"/>-icon is used
		for all associated types.

 	<h2>Modeloverview with inherited associations (Inheritance View)</h2>
 	<p>
 		The purpose of the inheritance view is to visualize the associations, which have been defined in the base projects,
 		in the currently selected project. It allows a quick overview of the relations in a project. An example of
 		this view for the previously introduced <em>Hausratmodell</em> is given by the following figure. It contains
 		only elements from the <em>Hausratmodell</em>. Instead of the element <em>Vertrag</em> we have its subtype
 		<em>Hausratvertrag</em> as root-element. It inherits all associations from its parent element. Therefore it has
 		now four associatiated elements which are shown in the  view. In addition to the two direct associations it
 		has two indirect (inherited) associations to the same elements. They have been retrieved via the <em>Deckungstyp</em>
 		association of <em>Vertrag</em>. The <img src="../../../images/views_editors/modeloverview/icons/OverrideIndicator_orange.gif"/>-icon
 		marks them as <em>inherited associations</em> and allows to distinguish them from direct associations.
 		This icon will only be applied to associations which have been inherited from another project, inside of the
 		selected project no associations will be inherited!

 	<h2>Switch views</h2>
 	<p>
 		Which view has to be displayed can be configured in the view-menu. Just select one of the provided views.

	</p>	

 	<h2>Labels</h2>
	<p>
		Labels can be used to display additional information about the shown elements. They always contain the name
		of the component type, but they can be configured to show information about the underlying association, cardinality
		and corresponding project, too.
	</p>
	<p>
 		<img src="../../../images/views_editors/modeloverview/label.PNG" alt="Element with a label showing information
 		 about the association, cardinality and project" />
	</p>
	<p>
		The labels are always structured as shown above. First comes the element name, which will always be displayed. Next
		comes the <em>target role name</em> of the association. A <em>/</em> indicates an association which defines a 
		<em>derived union</em>. The role name can be complemented by the associations <em>cardinality</em>. At last
		it is possible to show the project name of the current type. This is especially useful when using the <em>
		complete view</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Which parts of the labels are displayed can be configured in the view-menu.
