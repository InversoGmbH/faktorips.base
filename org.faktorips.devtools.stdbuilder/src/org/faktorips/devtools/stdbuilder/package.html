The standard builders. 

<h2>Naming conventions for builders</h2>
Builders are named according to the artefact they build / generate. If a builder generates a Java sourcefile
containing a published interface the builder is named XYZInterfaceBuilder, e.g. PolicyCmptInterfaceBuilder.
If the builder generates a Java sourcefile containing an implementation class the builder is named XYZImplClassBuilder.

<h2>Naming conventions for builder methods</h2>
getMethodNameXYZ		Returns the name of the generated method XYZ.
getMemberVarNameXYZ		Returns the name of the member var XYZ.
getConceptNameXYZ       You model concepts like policies, coverages, insured objects, etc. Depedending on the Java naming
						convention used, the concept coverage is represented as ICoverage in the published interface.
						However in methodnames we want to get for example <code>getCoverage</code> and not <code>getICoverage</code>.
						So we use getConceptNameXYZ methods to get the real concept names instead of getUnqualifiedName().
generateMethodZYX		Generates the sourcecode for the method XYZ
generateSignatureXYZ	Generates the signature of the method XYZ without a trailing ;
generateCodeForABC		Generates all sourcecode related to the object ABC
generateMemberVarXYZ	Generates the sourcecde for the member variable XYZ

<h2>Builder reference</h2>
implementationBuilder	In a builder that builds a published interface, this is the corresponding builder that builds the implementation.
interfaceBuilder		In a builder that builds an implementation class, this is the corresponding builder that builds the published interface.



<h2>API-Usage</h2>
Use the following naming convention classes:
JavaNamingConvention is available via getJavaNamingConvention()
